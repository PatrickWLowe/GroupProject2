## Description
#### This is going to be an app that tracks your daily nutritional intake. You will need to either login to your profile or create a new profile. The search bar is tied to Edamam's API which is connected to a database of nutritional information for most food that you can find at a grocery store. You will add your food and its weight to the search bar and receive nutritional facts based on the food type and weight. This info will be stored in SQL database and saved to the user that is logged in. Then the data will be compiled into a chart of your daily nutritional intake based on calories, vitamins, etc.
